# Hi, I'm Renan Akio Shibukawa! 👋

**Machine Learning Engineer | Data Scientist | M.Sc. in Computational Intelligence (UTFPR)**

I am a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about developing end-to-end solutions, from large-scale data extraction to AI orchestration and the automation of complex processes. Currently, I am pursuing a Professional Master's degree in Computer Science (Computational Intelligence) at UTFPR, where my research focuses on Deep Learning and Edge AI applied to agriculture (AgTech).

## 🚀 About Me
- 🌱 **Academic Research:** Developing Computer Vision solutions optimized for mobile devices (Edge AI). My work focuses on detecting leaf damage caused by pests in soybean crops using lightweight CNNs (like MobileNetV3).
- 💡 **Technical Focus:** Transforming unstructured data (PDFs, massive Web Scraping) into actionable assets, while ensuring data integrity and governance using tools like Pydantic.
- ⚙️ **Best Practices:** Rigorous application of Clean Code, SOLID principles, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to create scalable and easily maintainable AI solutions.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- **AI & Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Computer Vision (2D Images and 3D Point Clouds).
- **GenAI & LLM Engineering:** RAG Architectures, Advanced Prompt Engineering, Word Embeddings, Multi-provider API Integration.
- **Data Engineering & Backend:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), massive Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, Playwright), ETL pipelines on AWS S3, SQL, MongoDB, Data Contracts (Pydantic).
- **Visualization & Deployment:** Streamlit, Power BI, Google Analytics 4, Plotly, Matplotlib [4].

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🌾 [Soybean Pest Damage Classification with Edge AI](https://github.com/nanshibukawa/soybean-leaf-pest-damage)
Development of a highly efficient Computer Vision system designed to identify leaf damage in the field [2, 3]. This project utilizes Transfer Learning with a MobileNetV3 network and applies Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques for inference via TensorFlow Lite, significantly reducing latency and energy consumption on mobile devices.

### 🏭 GenAI and NLP Solutions for Maintenance 
Engineered a distributed Web Scraping pipeline processing over 1 million assets. Orchestrated multiple LLMs to extract intelligence from unstructured technical manuals (PDFs) via a RAG architecture, automating the generation of maintenance procedures and reducing the time required to access critical technical specifications.

### 🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/renanakioshibukawa/price-prediction-regression-model-analysis) | [Github](https://github.com/nanshibukawa/curitiba_realstate)
A personal Data Science project covering the entire lifecycle: real data collection via scraping, data cleaning, feature engineering, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and predictive regression modeling.

### 🛠️ In-Progress: Production-Ready AI Engineering
Specialization at DevEficiente – Focused on building scalable and reliable AI systems.

Advanced RAG & Retrieval: Implementing hybrid search (ColBERT, TF-IDF) and vector databases to minimize hallucinations and improve context relevance.

Agentic Workflows: Developing autonomous agents with persistent memory and complex task orchestration.

LLMOps & Governance: Applying LLM-as-a-Judge for automated evaluation, integration testing, and implementing Guardrails to ensure safe and predictable model outputs.
