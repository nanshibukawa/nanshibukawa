# Hi, I'm Renan Akio Shibukawa! 👋

**Machine Learning Engineer | Data Scientist | M.Sc. Candidate in Computational Intelligence**

I am a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about developing end-to-end solutions, from large-scale data extraction to AI orchestration and the automation of complex processes [1]. Currently, I am pursuing a Professional Master's degree in Computer Science (Computational Intelligence) at UTFPR, where my research focuses on Deep Learning and Edge AI applied to agriculture (AgTech) [1, 2].

## 🚀 About Me
- 🌱 **Academic Research:** Developing Computer Vision solutions optimized for mobile devices (Edge AI). My work focuses on detecting leaf damage caused by pests in soybean crops using lightweight CNNs (like MobileNetV3) [2, 3].
- 💡 **Technical Focus:** Transforming unstructured data (PDFs, massive Web Scraping) into actionable assets, while ensuring data integrity and governance using tools like Pydantic [1, 4].
- ⚙️ **Best Practices:** Rigorous application of Clean Code, SOLID principles, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to create scalable and easily maintainable AI solutions [5].

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- **AI & Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Computer Vision (2D Images and 3D Point Clouds) [6, 7].
- **GenAI & LLM Engineering:** RAG Architectures, Advanced Prompt Engineering, Word Embeddings, Multi-provider API Integration [4, 5].
- **Data Engineering & Backend:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), massive Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, Playwright), ETL pipelines on AWS S3, SQL, MongoDB, Data Contracts (Pydantic) [4, 5, 8].
- **Visualization & Deployment:** Streamlit, Power BI, Google Analytics 4, Plotly, Matplotlib [4].

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🌾 [Soybean Pest Damage Classification with Edge AI](https://github.com/nanshibukawa/soybean-leaf-pest-damage)
Development of a highly efficient Computer Vision system designed to identify leaf damage in the field [2, 3]. This project utilizes Transfer Learning with a MobileNetV3 network and applies Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques for inference via TensorFlow Lite, significantly reducing latency and energy consumption on mobile devices [2, 3].

### 🏭 GenAI and NLP Solutions for Maintenance 
Engineered a distributed Web Scraping pipeline processing over 1 million assets [5, 9]. Orchestrated multiple LLMs to extract intelligence from unstructured technical manuals (PDFs) via a RAG architecture, automating the generation of maintenance procedures and reducing the time required to access critical technical specifications [9].

### 🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction
